This project is based on the [GADS](https://gads.andela.com/community-projects) community project with [Google](https://google.com) and [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com)

Our team decided to build a solution for schools in Africa to help in the current Covid-19 pandemic.
We came up with a language learning app specifically for African students to help them learn their local languages.

### Features ðŸŽ¨
